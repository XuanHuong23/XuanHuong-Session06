            <p><b>This is the first item's accordion body.</b> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds
                the
                appropriate classes the we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as
                well
                as the showing and hiding via CSS trasitions. You can modify any of this with custom Css or overriding
                our
                default variables. It's also worth nothing that just about any HTML con go within the
                <b>.accordion-body</b>, though the transition does limit overflow.
